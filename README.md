# OpenATC
A GPT-3 based ATC AI for MSFS2020

I just started this because there seems to be a large want for this kind of thing. I have no idea where to start outside of a few ideas. 

Here is my propsal: 

- [ ] Develop GPT ATC model using existing modal, tune it to ATC commands
- [ ] Somehow tap into live traffic models and make sure AI ATC knows where that traffic is
- [ ] Create ingestion model for flight planning with popular flight planning tools 
- [ ] Work on voice-to-text input model for pilot to ATC comms
- [ ] Work on text-to-voice api for ATC to pilot Comms (could this some how leverage existing MSFS ATC Voices?)
